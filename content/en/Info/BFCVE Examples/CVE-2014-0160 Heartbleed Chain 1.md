			<td>Code Defect Bug</td>
	<td>A bug is in the operation. It is the first cause for the chain of weaknesses underlying a software security vulnerability. It must be fixed to resolve the vulnerability.</td>

	<tr>
			<td>   Inconsistent Value</td>
	<td>Data value does not correspond to the value of a related data (e.g., inconstancy between the value of a size variable and the actual buffer size).</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
			<td>   Wrong Size</td>
	<td>The value used as size does not match the actual size of the object.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
			<td>Address Error/Fault</td>

			<td>   Over Bounds Pointer</td>

			<td>   Quantity</td>
	<td>Check data for a specific measurable value (e.g., size, time, rate, frequency).</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
			<td>   Sequential</td>
	<td>The operation is performed after iterating over the object elements.</td>

	<tr>
			<td>Execution Space</td>
	<td>Shows where buggy/faulty operation code is running or with what privilege level).</td>

			<td>   Local</td>
	<td>The bugged code runs in an environment with access control policy with limited (local user) permission.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
			<td>   Userland</td>
	<td>The bugged code runs in an environment with privilege levels, but in unprivileged mode (e.g., ring 3 in x86 architecture).</td>

	</tr>
	<tr>
			<td>   Heap</td>
	<td>The object is a dynamically allocated data structure (e.g., via malloc() and new).</td>
