# BF Impact

BF will allow precise communication about software bugs and weaknesses and will help identify exploit mitigation techniques.

➢ Government could improve the descriptions in public vulnerability repositories and create policies and guidelines for software testing.

➢ Software companies could improve the testing tools and their bug reports and implement automatic bugs finding and fixing.

➢ Professors could teach better about bugs and weaknesses and conduct research on formalizing software bugs.

All this will lead to improved communication about software vulnerabilities, increased precision of code review tools, and decreasing software bugs and weaknesses.
