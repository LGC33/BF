# The BF Tool <br/>_`Irena Bojanova, Primary Investigator and Lead, Bugs Framework (BF)`_

The Bugs Framework (BF) Tool facilitates the use of the BF taxonomy in describing software security vulnerabilities according to the BF Vulnerability Model. You will be able to create BF vulnerabilities decryptions as those showcased from the "APIs>BFCVE API" and the  "APIs>BFCWE API" menu at the top of this webpage, and graphical representations as those showcased under the BFCVE menu on the left of this webpage.

Please register here to download the BF tool. We ask you only for an email address to which to send you a unique download link and for the name of your organization to informa our management about the interest in BF.
