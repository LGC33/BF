		<tr>
			<td><strong>Classes</strong></td>
	<td><strong>Definition</strong></td>

	<tr>
			<td>MUS</td>
	<td>An object is initialized, read, written, or cleared improperly.</td>

			<td><strong>Operations</strong></td>
	<td><strong>Definition</strong></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
			<td>Clear</td>
	<td>Change the meaningful value of an object to a non-meaningful one (e.g. via zeroization) -- e.g. before object's deallocated.</td>

	<tr>
			<td><strong>Causes/Consequences</strong></td>
	<td><strong>Definition</strong></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
			<td>Code Defect Bug</td>
	<td>A bug is in the operation. It is the first cause for the chain of weaknesses underlying a software security vulnerability. It must be fixed to resolve the vulnerability.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
			<td>   Missing Code</td>
	<td>The entire operation or part of it is absent.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
			<td>Memory Corruption/Disclosure Final Error</td>
	<td>Undefined or exploitable system behavior caused by memory allocation, use, and deallocation bugs.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
			<td>   Not Cleared Object</td>
	<td>The object's data value is not changed to a non-meaningful one before deallocation.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
			<td><strong>Operation Attributes</strong></td>
	<td><strong>Definition</strong></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
			<td>Mechanism</td>
	<td>Shows how the buggy/faulty operation code is performed.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
			<td>   Sequential</td>
	<td>The operation is performed after iterating over the object elements.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
			<td>Source Code</td>
	<td>Shows where the buggy/faulty operation code is in the program -- in what kind of software.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
			<td>   Codebase</td>
	<td>The operation is in the programmer's code - in the application itself.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
			<td>Execution Space</td>
	<td>Shows where buggy/faulty operation code is running or with what privilege level).</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
			<td>   Userland</td>
	<td>The bugged code runs in an environment with privilege levels, but in unprivileged mode (e.g., ring 3 in x86 architecture).</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
			<td><strong>Operand Attributes</strong></td>
	<td><strong>Definition</strong></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
			<td>Address Kind</td>
	<td>Shows how much memory is accessed outside object's bounds.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
			<td>   Huge</td>
	<td>More than 1 KB of memory.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
			<td>Address State</td>
	<td>Shows where the allocated memory is.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
			<td>   Heap</td>
	<td>The object is a dynamically allocated data structure (e.g., via malloc() and new).</td>
	</tr>
