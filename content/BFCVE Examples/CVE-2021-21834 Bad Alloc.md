	</tr>
	<tr>
			<td>DVR</td>
	<td>Data are verified (semantics check) or corrected (assign, remove) improperly.</td>

			<td>TCM</td>
	<td>An arithmetic expression (over numbers, strings, or pointers) is calculated improperly, or a boolean condition is evaluated improperly.</td>

			<td>Code Defect Bug</td>
	<td>A bug is in the operation. It is the first cause for the chain of weaknesses underlying a software security vulnerability. It must be fixed to resolve the vulnerability.</td>

			<td>   Wrong Argument</td>
	<td>Inaccurate input data value, i.e., non-verified for harmed semantics.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
			<td>   Wrap Around</td>
	<td>A moved around-the-clock value over its data type upper or lower range, as it exceeds that range. (Integer Over-/Under-flow is a wrapped-around the upper/lower range integer value; may become very small/large and change to the opposite sign.</td>
