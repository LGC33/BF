	</tr>
	<tr>
			<td>MAD</td>
	<td>The pointer to an object is initialized, repositioned, or reassigned to an improper memory address.</td>

			<td><strong>Operations</strong></td>
	<td><strong>Definition</strong></td>

			<td>Initialize (pointer)</td>
	<td>Change the undefined data value a pointer to a meaningful object address; and positions the pointer at the start of the object.</td>

			<td><strong>Causes/Consequences</strong></td>
	<td><strong>Definition</strong></td>

	<tr>
			<td>Code Defect Bug</td>
	<td>A bug is in the operation. It is the first cause for the chain of weaknesses underlying a software security vulnerability. It must be fixed to resolve the vulnerability.</td>

	<tr>
			<td>   Missing Code</td>
	<td>The entire operation or part of it is absent.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
			<td>Address Error/Fault</td>
	<td>The used object address is wrong.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
			<td>   Wild Pointer</td>
	<td>Points to an arbitrary address, because it has not been initialized or an erroneous allocation routine is used.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
			<td>Memory Corruption/Disclosure Final Error</td>
	<td>Undefined or exploitable system behavior caused by memory allocation, use, and deallocation bugs.</td>
	</tr>

			<td>Mechanism</td>
	<td>Shows how the buggy/faulty operation code is performed.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
			<td>   Direct</td>
	<td>The operation is performed over a particular object element.</td>

	<tr>
			<td>   Explicit</td>

			<td>Source Code</td>
	<td>Shows where the buggy/faulty operation code is in the program -- in what kind of software.</td>

	<tr>
			<td>   Codebase</td>

			<td>Execution Space</td>
	<td>Shows where buggy/faulty operation code is running or with what privilege level).</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
			<td>   Userland</td>
