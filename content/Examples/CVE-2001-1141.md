        <h3>BF Taxonomy</h3>
      </p>
      <ul><strong>Cause: </strong>
        <cause>Improper PRNG Algorithm</cause> (C <code>md_rand</code> - the secret PRNG state is updated with portion,
        as small as on byte, of the PRNG's previous output, which is not secret)
      </ul>
      <ul><strong>Attributes: </strong>
        <ul>Function: <attribute>Mixing</attribute> (back into entropy pool)</ul>
        <ul>Algorithm: <attribute>Hash Function </attribute>(<attribute> SHA-1</attribute> used for PRNG output and to
          update its internal secret state)</ul>
        <ul>Used For: <attribute>Generation</attribute> (of cryptographic keying material - nonces, cryptographic keys)
        </ul>
        <ul><u>Pseudo-Randomness Requirement</u>: <attribute>Sufficicent Space Size</attribute> and <attribute>

        <h3>BF Description</h3>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <cause>Use of improper PRNG algorithm</cause> (C <code> md_rand</code> uses <attribute>SHA-1</attribute> for
        <attribute>mixing</attribute> back in the entropy pool portion, as small as one byte, of previous output to
        update PRNG’s state), allows <attribute>generation</attribute> of cryptographic keying material (nonces and
        cryptographic keys) that does not satisfy the <attribute>sufficient space size</attribute> and <attribute>
          unpredictability</attribute> (can be predicted from previous values through brute force) pseudo-randomness
        requirements, which leads to <consequence>KMN</consequence>>Generate and <consequence>IEX</consequence> of
        future <consequence>keying material</consequence>.
      </ul>

      <p>
        <h3>Analysis</h3>
      </p>
      <p>
      <ul>A PRNG used for cryptography does not satisfy the requirement of unpredictability from previous values,
        because the internal state can be determined from number of output requests. Possible consequences include: IEX
        of future PRNG output (CVE-2001-1141) (which is KMN>Generation failure) and weak encryption, confidentiality
        compromise (which is ENC>Confidentiality failure).</ul>
      </p>
      <p>
      <ul>The entropy accumulation implementation (entropy pool and associated mixing function) allows reconstruction of
        the PRNG internal state . The mixing hash function for md (in the C <code>md_rand</code>) gets half of the
        previous value of md and bytes from the PRNG internal state. Wrongly, the half used is the one with the PRNG’s
        previous output (failed implementation relative to specification). Also, the number of used state bytes depends
        on the number of bytes requested as output, which could be as small as one byte. This enables a brute-force
        attack. The PRNG state could be reconstructed from the output of one large PRNG request (large enough to gain
        knowledge on md) followed by consecutive 1-byte PRNG requests.</ul>
