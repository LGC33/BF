# BF Model of Information Exposure

### Information and Data

The terms data and information are often used interchangeably. Data is “a set of values of qualitative or quantitative variables” [1]. Information is “any entity or form that provides the answer to a question of some kind or resolves uncertainty" [2]. To what extent data is informative to someone depends on how unexpected it is to that person. A difference between data and information is that data has no meaning, while information has meaning. Information and data are on a continuum. Bits in memory are data. Without external context (meaning), the bits might represent an integer, an address, a set of flags or other low-level information. At a higher level, the integer could be someone’s age, the number of characters in a document, or a temperature. Typically, a person’s age is considered information, whereas “temperature” may be considered data, since it may be yesterday’s high temperature (where?) or the current temperature in a furnace. Without further meaning, it is unclear whether the temperature is in Centigrade, Fahrenheit, Kelvin, or something else!

In software, information is generated by processing data. [3] We distinguish between information that is sensitive and information that is not. Certain kinds of information can be indirectly sensitive: when revealed can lead to harmful consequences.

If sensitive information at rest in a file or a database is encrypted (see BF class ENC), then information cannot actually be exposed. If information is communicated outside the system via a secure channel, it cannot be exposed, either.

Sensitive information includes credentials, system data, state data, cryptographic data, digital documents, and personally identifiable and business data.

Credentials include password, token, smart card, digital certificate, and biometrics, such as fingerprints, hand configuration, retina, iris, and voice characteristics. System data could be pathnames, configurations, logs, and Web usage. State data includes ooperational data, such as SQL table names and column names, ports used, and server names. Cryptographic data is hashes, keys, and keying material, such as cryptographic keys, initialization vectors, shared secrets, domain parameters, random seeds, salts, and nonces.

Personally identifiable data corresponds to personally identifiable information (PII) and personally identifiable financial information (PIFI). PII is any information that could be used to distinguish one person from another – e.g. social security number (SSN), driver’s license number, identification card number. PIFI includes financial account numbers with security codes/ access codes/ password. There is also protected health information, which includes a patient's medical record or payment history, and payment card information, such as cardholder name, service code, expiration date, CVC2/ CVV2/ CID value, PIN or PIN block, content of magnetic stripe, etc.

Business data covers intellectual property and trade secrets, operational and inventory data, and industry-specific data, in addition to customer and employee data.

### Information Exposure Model

To ground information exposure, we have developed a general model. “Exposure” is to any entity that should not have that information, not just information that is a security concern.

Fig. 1 presents our BF information exposure bugs model, showing through what channels software could expose information.

Information is stored on disks in files or in databases. Programs (source code and executables) are also stored on a disk in files and do not require any other resources. [4] A program is comprised of functions’ invocations. Most functions process input data into output information or data. However, some functions receive only control flow, e.g. to display information, error messages, dialogs; or to act on a global data value or when a state variable has changed or needs to be assessed. [5] A process is a program in execution and holds resources such as CPU, memory, disk, and input/output. A program can involve more than one process. [4] A session is a temporary, interactive information interchange between two or more devices, or between a computer and a user (e.g. login session). [6]

Information exposure may happen when either unintended information is carried, or an unintended recipient gets the information. The exposure may be accidentally or because of attacker’s actions.

Information could leak through _legitimate channels_ during normal use of software. For example, via information display, via queries (including query strings in SQL queries and GET request), from hardcoded information (password, cryptographic key, etc.), class cloning, serializable classes, when public methods access private variables, inappropriate cleanup, or from session and process environments. Cleanup includes removing previously used information, buffer cleanup (dead store removal), and use of `realloc``()`. Sessions may leak information via session-ID length, sessions state boundaries, caching, and improper cleanup.

A _diagnostic_ _channel_, or error channel, is a legitimate channel that helps users and developers diagnose, find, and correct input or code errors. Information may be leaked via error messages, exception handling messages, or other responses to erroneous inputs or erroneous data processing. If an attacker forces and internal fault, it may divulge sensitive information, including details on the software implementation logic, to the attacker. [7]

A _side channel_ is not intended to transmit information; however, it does transmit information [8]. Information may be revealed or deduced due to discrepancies or behavioral inconsistencies. For example, conveying different responses (e.g. an operation is successful or not), taking different time (e.g. CPU timing), consuming different power, using different storage, or emitting different electromagnetic radiation. Behavioral inconsistency could be internal or external.

A _covert channel_ is a side channel that is created deliberately as a hidden communication channel [9]. Unfortunately, a covert channel may be created by optimization techniques, such as compiler optimizations [10] and speculative executions [11].

In a side channel, it is common for an attacker to control both the part that induces the side effect and the part that measures it [12, 13, 14]. In other cases, there

could be two collaborating attackers: an unauthorized user controlling the part that induces the side effect and a third party controlling the part that measures it. There could be also only a passive attacker, who observes an existing (not induced) behavioral inconsistency. Usually, statistical analysis of the measurements is involved. [15] describes creating covert channels using TCP/IP. Examples of side/covert attacks are Meltdown and Spectre [16], as well as the inference attacks [17].
