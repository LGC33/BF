      <description>BF Randomness Model#Randomness#Randomness has application in many fields, including cryptography, simulation, statistics, politics, science, and gaming. Any specific use has its own requirements for randomness â€“ e.g., random bit generation for cryptography or security purposes has stronger requirements than generation for other purposes. For cryptography or security purposes, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) recommends use of cryptographically secure Pseudo-Random Bit Generators (PRBGs). They are subject to the requirements in NIST SP 800-90A, NIST SP 800-90B and NIST SP 800-90C.</description>

      <description>True-Random Number Bugs (TRN) Class#Note
This class is still under development. The information will be updated soon.
Definition#We define True-Random Number Bugs (TRN) as:
The software generated output does not satisfy all use-specific true-randomness requirements.
Note that the output sequence is of random bits, where values are obtained from one or more sources of entropy.
